# Library Socialism 101
## Foundational principles
### Usufruct
  _The right of using and enjoying the profits of an estate or other thing belonging to another, without impairing the substance._ [^4]

Usufruct is the key to library socialism - and how it can radically change the nature of a capitalist society. 

Unlike the myth of capitalism, where work is rewarded, the nature of capitalism is that ownership of tools, the means of production, and sufficient resources to keep workers alive while they create goods and services is the claim to the profits that capitalists claim as their property (see [surplus value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_value)). 

Library socialism instead offers another means of distributing goods, both capital and consumer.  It offers to make us all much richer on average by ensuring that goods and services are distributed to where they solve the most needs, not just generate the most profits.  And by sharing items, it means that fewer items can satisfy the wants of a society completely.  

#### abusus
Library socialism does remove the right of abusus, Latin for abuse.  This is the right to destroy or deny property to others.  It is also the right that is necessary in order to exploit labor.  

Take the simplest example of a farm employing labor.  The farmer is unable to work so much land themselves, which is why they seek to employ labor to begin with, expecting that the profit of that labor will be greater than the cost in paying for it.  Assuming the laborer is not currently starving, though, why would they not simply use the unused land and grow food for themselves, keeping the amount they would have to pay to the farmer?

The laborer would like to, but is prohibited from doing so because the farmer has the legal right of abusus.  Not only can they use the land, but they are legally empowered to deny its use to others, and to even destroy it if they wish to.  They can then use this to create an artifical scarcity, and use that scarcity to extract value and concessions from the laborer.


#### plain terms
In the simplest terms, the right of usufruct means you can use things to profit yourself and help yourself, but you cannot deny them to others when you're not using them, and you do not have the right to destroy them to prevent others from using them.   The farmer is welcome to grow crops on their land - but if they choose not to, somebody else can use the land to do so.

Given this, it's quite easy to see that this principle *already* exists in public libraries.  You can borrow a book to help you start a business, but you can't prevent others from reading it after you - or threaten to destroy the book unless you are given the profits of the next reader's business.  You can hold the book exclusively, but *only* temporarily.


### Irreducible Minimum
The irreducible minimum is a concept similar to that of Universal Basic Income - but instead of universal inputs, we aim for universal outcomes.[^1]  So instead of providing a check for $2000 a month (much of which will be captured immediately by landlords), we instead say that every member of the society should be able to sleep indoors, in a private room, etc.

This may sound idealistic, but note that also while certain numbers are not flexible (the number of calories a human needs, etc), for many others we can start with low levels, and increase this minimum as the wealth of the library society increases.   

Note also that unlike other socialist systems, the irreducable minimum does not prohibit people who want to work to gain more for themselves.  But since it does ensure that others will not be coerced by starvation and homelessness, it does require that they actually provide valuable labor to society to do so.


#### the malthusian objection
A typical argument given against any long term society that guarantees the needs of its members without condition is that it will lead to a massive increase in birth rates, quickly ensuring the per-capita resources cannot increase.  This is also known as [Malthusianiism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism).  

However almost all observed societies since the Industrial Revolution have shown instead that this is not how humans behave.  High birth rates seem to be associated solely with agriculture socities (which were the ones Malthus originally described).  As socieities industrialize, birth rates fall.  

Related to this is a claim that, absent the coercion of starvation or homelessness, humans will not work.  For an in-depth exploration of this, we will defer to the book _Bullshit Jobs_ by Graber [^2].


#### consumable items
This area often brings up one of the most common objections to library socialism - namely, what about items that are not to be returned?  What about food?

Many current movements seek to escape this through a foundation as a gift economy.  This is not incompatible with library socialism - a gift, after all, is simply a loan that never expires.  A loan is probably a more preferable structure, actually - since it can require that the item is not put into the capitalist system when the recipient is done with it, but instead is returned to the alternative system instead.

In most current societies, there are more than enough calories produced to support every person - the issue is instead with distribution.

Another way to see this is that even consumables are returned, in an ecological sense.  As said by the SRSLY Wrong hosts in response to a heckler, the only way to avoid returning food in a library society is to refuse to compost or flush your waste, and store it in jars.  As most people would prefer NOT to hoard their feces, seeing food as borrowed becomes more natural.


### Complentarity
Complementarity is partially an idea that differences in a non-hierarchical organization can be generative, instead of constructive [^3].

As an example within a library, imagine ebooks where not only can highlights be shared (like today's Kindle offers), but margin notes can be shared, commented and responded to and edited, etc.  The original authors work is being continously enhanced and added to (complemented) by the actions of the borrowers, who move beyond the simple passive consumers of the capitalist system.  

#### efficiency in library socialism over capitalism
Library socialism can offer a system which actually offers great efficiencies, unlike capitalism which claims to do so but often spends massive resources making things LESS useful in order to protect property rights of [[librarysocialism101#Abusus|Abusus]].  One example in today's libraries is Digital Rights Management for ebooks.  Apps such as Libby are unweildy to use precisely because the supply is artificially limited, and must spend massive amounts of engineering simply to prevent the rentention of a book.  Instead greater plenty is possible by removing property rights, namely that of copyright, while the [[librarysocialism101#Irreducible Minimum|irreducible minimum]] solves the issue of how creators can be supported.  Further rewards can of course be given by the society to producers - but there is no reason to artificially limit supply of creative works simply to force a price.
