## Problem:

A house was purchased for 635K 2 years ago, with a down payment of 60K and monthly payments of 4K.  We added solar power at a cost of 50K. \
 \
We wish to sell the house, but the market has suddenly turned soft.  A few months ago, it was being valued at 799K, but now nobody is buying!  We need to move however, and can’t necessarily remain living in the house until the market recovers.  But also we don’t want to sell for cheap and go underwater!

So what to do?  Well, the rental market is good!  So we rent out the house!  But . . . just ask Adam Smith, landlords are bad!  So how to square this?

Well, landlords are bad because basically they force tenants to pay the mortgage, then keep the profits when the property appreciates (and many even take more).  But what if we didn’t do that?

While we might not have the capital to keep rents low enough so the tenant does not have to pay any equity, we COULD at least make sure the part of the appreciation they paid for gets back to them, couldn’t we?

Previously this would be very hard, as tenets rarely stay the entire length of a mortgage, or even the period before an owner sells, and so keeping track of them to reimburse becomes prohibitively complicated.

However today we could instead use crypto tokens on the blockchain instead.   \
 \
How does this work?


## Solution

We start by creating a DAO (distributed autonomous organization).  We can use the tools of the Aragon project to do so.  To avoid high charges and fees, we will create this on the Polygon chain, NOT the main Ethereum one. \
 \
We will need tokens to issue, which the DAO creation tools will help us make.  For ease of use, we want to issue one token for every dollar that anyone (owner, tenant, relative, etc) pays towards the house.  We will exclude utilities and the like, and focus only on the things needed for ownership (mortgage, interest, taxes, PMI, major improvments, etc).  This can be MUCH more than the purchase price, so we want to mint many more tokens than that price.  Excess tokens will only be held by the DAO, and “burnt” (destroyed) before we split up proceeds, so it’s OK to have too many. 

In our example, our total costs are at least 685K - but a mortgage may require 3x the cost to pay off.  So for safety, we will mint 2.5 million tokens, and call them HOS. \
 \
We then must distribute the tokens.  We will transfer them to the DAO finance wallet.  We then will also give tokens to the landlord - for any amounts they have paid so far (in our example, the down payment, the  \
 \
Each month, in exchange for rent, a tenant will be issued an equal amount of tokens to their wallet.  If the tenant leaves, they will retain these tokens.


### Should tokens be transferable?

DAO tokens can be created as transferable (meaning they can be sold between third parties) or non-transferrable (cannot leave the wallet they were created with).  In most cases, a secondary market is a benefit.  There is however a danger that capital could use the economic precarity of tenants to buy tokens on the cheap, and then 

2 solutions are possible.  One is to make tokens non-transferrable - they simply become worthless after the property is sold and proceeds are distributed.   \
 \
The second would be to use the blockchain to calculate the price paid for the token, and only pay out a maximum amount related to that.  Excess funds would then go where?


## Sale of the property

When the property is sold, we can now split the proceeds in a way that distributes the benefits in exact proportion to how much each participant (landlord and tenants) put in. \
 \
First, any remaining tokens in the DAO should be “burnt” (sent to a null address and destroyed). \
 \
Then the total amount of tokens remaining is the amount of shares to divide.  We take the sale proceeds (after we pay off the remaining mortgage), and divide it by the number of shares.  This is the price per token that the DAO will pay out tokens at. \
 \
Ideally this can all be done on chain with a stable coin - the tokens are taken by the DAO in exchange for the price per token, and the tokens are then burnt.  However direct payments off-chain can also be done - once completed, the tokens paid for should be burnt as well.


## Benefits


### To the renter:

The renter now can receive the part of the house which they paid for with their rent. \
 \



### To the landlord:

The landlord can escape exploiting their fellow workers.  In addition, this can offer a significant competitive advantage to attracting renters, since other landlords offer no return of equity to the tenant. \
