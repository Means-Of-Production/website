        <h1>Cryptocurrency in library socialism</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><a href="https://librarysocialism.org">Library socialism</a> is an emergent framework for imagining ownership
        and management of the commons. In a nutshell, library socialism is moving all property into a library system.
        Library members can use goods and services as needed and then return items as they’re no longer required. Many
        consumable items, such as food, may be considered permanent loans - or libraries may accept returns of processed
        items (such as compost for food).</p>

        <p>This solution has the potential to move past capitalism gradually. However, it also has some issues we must
            resolve if any library system is to work long-term, much less supplant capitalism. These include
            incentivizing work within the system, attracting capital resources, preventing drain by private actors, and
            dealing with bad faith members who destroy or steal goods.</p>

        <p>Cryptocurrency, while currently mainly a speculative asset, can offer some practical solutions to these
            problems. Particularly with smart contracts, it is possible to create tokens/currency with limitations placed
            upon them to behave better than money. In addition, since speculation has fueled development, many tools
            already exist to manage this that we, as library socialists, can quickly adapt for our uses! In particular,
            the work done on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) will enable us to create library systems that
            are easy to manage while encouraging growth.

    <div class="row">
        <h2>Token Types</h2>
        <div class="container">
        <h3>Membership</h3>
        <p>The membership token indicates that a person who owns a wallet is a member of the library and may
            participate in the library, using items and services - as well as voting on matters that the library
            needs to decide.
        </p>
        <p>These tokens are **non-transferable** - once given to a wallet, that token cannot be sold or given away.
            Only our organization/DAO can issue new ones. In addition, we prevent more than one token from being held
            in a wallet so that each person can have only one vote.
        </p>
        <p>If a user becomes a problem, the library may vote to revoke their token (and membership). They can be issued
            another later if the user can resolve the issues.
        </p>
            <p>An example of this token exists on the Ethereum and Polygon chains as the
                <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0xB47D9011Bf2171FCb3108d4D6944AF60b204F5CD">Means of Production (MOP)</a>
            token.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <h3>Labor token</h3>
        <p>Labor tokens are similar to the idea of labor vouchers used in many forms of socialist theory. We recognize
            this when people do useful work for the library by issuing them labor tokens. We denominate these in hours.</p>
        <p>Labor tokens are also <b>non-transferable</b>. The library issues these to the wallet of the person who did the work, and that person can, from there **only** transfer them back to the library (smart contracts allow us to enforce this restriction). This restriction prevents their use as cash and prevents users from hoarding them to use for the exploitation of the labor of others. It also ensures that the library can enforce a policy regarding labor tokens.
        <div class="row">
        <h4>Uses of labor tokens</h4>
        <div class="row">
            <h5>Fines and fees</h5>
            <p>During the use of the library, a member may damage, lose, or return late items. To discourage this, the library can impose fines to remain in good standing and be able to use things and vote. Users pay these fines using labor tokens. If a member does not have labor tokens, they can instead obtain them by donating money or items to the library and exchanging the proceeds of that for labor tokens (discussed under Capital Tokens)</p>
            <p>A library may also want to create a base cost of use for its members - this membership fee would function exactly as a fine and require labor tokens to pay.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h5>Withdrawals</h5>

            <p>Users may transfer labor tokens for other cryptocurrencies (and eventually to cash) at the library’s
                discretion. This rate, set democratically by the library as a whole, is the wage rate the library pays
                people for work. The library must be careful to ensure that it has enough free resources to pay out any
                labor tokens - and if withdrawals reduce library funds, then this exchange rate should fall. This price
                mechanism can help to prevent total withdrawals. The library may also set the exchange rate to
                automatically update with withdrawals, decreasing the exchange value of labor tokens if withdrawal rates
                increase and lowering the rate if withdrawals reduce.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h5>line skipping auctions</h5>
            <p>Labor tokens also have another use within the library - line skipping.</p>

            <p>In a library, more members will demand some items than we can supply at once. We usually deal with
                this through <b>waiting lists</b> - as people use and return the item, the people waiting for the
                thing get their turn in the order they requested.
            </p>

            <p>However, to incentivize doing labor for the library, the labor token offers the holders another
                option - they can instead bid to have the next loan go to someone else.</p>

            <p>Note that in this auction, a person does not have to bid only for themselves - they can bid for
                someone else to be given the next loan, and the total amount of bids for each person will
                determine who gets it. This ability to bid for others allows people who wish to work together to
                borrow library resources they will mutually benefit from while still keeping labor tokens
                non-transferable.
            </p>
            <p>When the current loan expires and the item is marked as ready to loan, the library loans the article
                to the member who has the most tokens bid for the next turn and transfers any tokens bid for that
                member to the wallet of the library.
            </p>
            <p>Tokens will be held in escrow during an auction to prevent double bidding of the same tokens.</p>
            <h6>Quadratic costs for line skipping</h6>
            <p>To prevent anyone from using their capital or saved labor tokens to monopolize a resource, the cost
                of line skipping should increase as a member seeks to hold the item for longer and longer.
            </p>

            <p>Taking a cue from the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting">quadratic voting</a>,
                we do not prevent the current holder from bidding on the item again, but we do make it increasingly
                expensive. So, for example, if the bid is for the person currently borrowing the article, and they have
                consecutively held the thing num_turns, their bid will cost `2^num_turns` more. So your bids become
                worth ½, then ¼, and ⅛, and so on, as you hold the item more and more turns, but still cost as much.
            </p>
            <p>This way, the cost to retain an item will quickly increase, promoting turnover while still allowing
                people to indicate their preferences more granularly than a simple binary on a list or off.
            </p>

<div class="row">
    <h4>Bonuses</h4>
    <p>Certain things should pay a bonus above regular hourly tokens - but this is highly limited, as we, as library
        socialists, do not want to reintroduce a system of wage slavery.</p>
    <p>Should bonuses be another token with slightly less use than regular labor tokens?</p>
    <p>
        <h5>Items for bonus</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>onerous work - if you have to clean shit, you shouldn’t have to do as long</li>

        <li>automation - If you can design a system to save 100 hours of work, you should get labor vouchers for what
            you saved to encourage innovation, but we also want to prevent ownership of the machine users by designers
</br>
            But who determines the amount saved?</li>

        <li>Highly skilled labor - we handle this, when needed, through capital tokens</li>
        </ul>


</div>

<div class="row">
<h3>Capital token</h3>



Capital tokens are issued when the library receives value from the outside that is not labor - usually a donation of cash or items. These the library denominates in cash value. In the case of item donation, the library must determine a fair means to appraise the item.

Capital tokens are **transferable** - if the holders wish to give or sell them to others, the library does not care. Therefore, a secondary market in capital tokens (by listing them on crypto exchanges), if one develops, would not impact the library at all, though it could make members more willing to donate funds for them if they have an outside value as well.





#### Temporary loans to the library 



In many cases, especially with distributed libraries, people may choose to make an item available for lending only temporarily. 

In this case, we will wish to compensate the owner for the depreciation but not the total cost of the item. 

If a user damages an item beyond repair, the library can pay capital tokens as insurance to the owner of the item.





#### Highly skilled labor



Likewise, for some services requiring extensive training or licensing, the library should compensate the provider for investing human capital outside the library. Examples would be doctors providing medical care who have gone to schools they paid for themselves. 

To determine the capital the library should pay, we should evaluate the ratio of the contract of services provided to a whole working career, with the ultimate amount determined by need and voting in the library.





#### Exchange



Holders of capital tokens can exchange them for labor tokens. This mechanism incentivizes increasing the resources of the library as a whole. 

The rate of exchange of capital for labor tokens will be set democratically by the library - this is also a reflection of the wage discussed above under labor token withdrawals. The library may choose to keep a lower rate of exchange of capital than this wage, but it can never be higher (otherwise, a speculator can make a profit simply by trading cash for capital tokens, then labor, then back to cash).

## Example flows





#### Basic work



A member does 5 hours of work for the library.  



They are paid five labor tokens from the DAO.





#### member donates capital 



A member donates goods worth $500 to the library. Our library has no loans over three months and a current wage of **$50/hour**.



They are granted 500 capital tokens from the DAO.



They can exchange these for ten labor tokens at the current exchange rate.





#### Members bid to skip a line



Matt and Doug both have ten labor tokens from work they have done and wish to throw a party on a yacht. 

Shelly has 15 tokens and wants to go sailing as well. 

Carol is currently using the yacht until Monday. 

Shelly adds her name to the waiting list. 

Doug adds his name to the waiting list. 

Not wanting to wait, Doug starts an auction for Doug and pledges ten tokens for Doug. The library puts his tokens in an escrow account. 

Shelly bids 15 tokens for Shelly. The library puts her tokens in the escrow account as well.



Matt bids ten tokens for Doug. The library puts his tokens in the escrow account as well.

On Monday, Carol returns the yacht on time. 

The auction ends with Doug having the most tokens pledged. 

The library returns Shelly her tokens from escrow. 

The library transfers Matt and Doug’s tokens back to itself.

The library allows Doug to borrow the yacht.





#### Member bids to keep extending loan 



Doug has had the yacht for two turns, having bid up the line last time.



He wishes to keep the yacht for yet another turn, but Shelly is on the waiting list. 

Doug starts an auction for the yacht and bids 100 hours. Since he has already had the yacht two times, his bid COSTS 100 hours but only counts as 25 hours (100/2^2). Therefore, 100 hours are put in escrow from him. 

Shelly bids 30 hours for the yacht. As a result, 30 hours are put in escrow from her. 

She wins the auction, and Doug has to return the yacht for her use for a standard period.





#### Highly skilled labor



Alice spends 500K to attend medical school, expecting a career of 40 hrs/wk for 50 years, for a total of 100,000 hours.  



She agrees to provide medical services for 5 hours a week for library patrons for a year.  



The contract should award her $25 in capital tokens a week, in addition to 5hrs labor tokens per week - this is the cost of her education divided by the total hours - ($5/hr), multiplied by the number of hours she works for the library.

## Frequently Asked Questions





### Energy use 





#### “Isn’t cryptocurrency horrible for the environment?” 



It can be. Bitcoin (BTC) is - however, nothing here uses BTC. Instead, we use the Polygon chain, which [claims](https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-reaches-first-sustainability-milestone-by-achieving-carbon-neutrality/) to be carbon neutral. The Ethereum network it uses is not - however it is currently moving from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, and thus will cut its energy use by over 90%. Other projects such as [Energy Web](https://www.energyweb.org/) can also provide a means to store library capital to drive climate justice in interactions with the capitalist world until library socialism can meaningfully address climate change through direct democracy.





### Why crypto at all? 





#### “Why not just run a database and a website?” 



Most of the library software does, for now, run on a database rather than on the blockchain. However, the blockchain can offer a few advantages in the areas marked here.







* Transparency - especially in any financial matters, it is crucial that the validity and honesty of transactions and organizations be apparent to all involved. A distributed ledger aids in this by ensuring that any financial decisions made by the organization are available for community scrutinization.

    * Privacy of loans is also a significant concern here, so while financial matters might be held on chain, actual loan records should not be. Oracle systems can provide sanitized information if limited aggregate loan information is needed.

* Tooling - great efforts have been taken in the VC glut of crypto to develop tools for many of the capabilities that a library organization would need, with the benefit that we do not have to devote scarce resources at first to them and can instead focus on building library capabilities. Some are

    * Voting - the [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) project supplies ready-made, secure voting abilities for libraries, including templates for one-person, one-vote organizations instead of just corporate-style stock control

    * Banking - because DAOs include a wallet, they bypass, for now, the need to set up bank accounts and corporate or legal entities in the capitalist system, at the cost of forcing people seeking to donate cash to the project to navigate (or be given help navigating) crypto exchanges.   

* Distributed mechanism - a central server can, long term, mean that a centralized bureaucracy controls and maintains it. This bureaucracy provides a natural collection point of power to develop into a hierarchy and, in the most and worst case, a nomenklatura. However, blockchains have a unique property, when using smart contracts, of making the executive functions of any governing body utterly subject to the legislative ones which approve the contracts.

* Avoidance of tech monopolies and government attacks - currently, our systems are hosted on Google Cloud, a capitalist entity. While constructing a library socialist cloud platform is one of the projects our organizations will want to work on, using capitalist networks temporarily is a necessary evil. Furthermore, without a library socialist cloud platform, the system must either be error-prone and require large amounts of engineering resources - or be subject to possible removal by government or corporate entities. And while both these options are fine with general library software, the ledgers of financial records for the library will require a higher standard to inspire and retain confidence.





#### “Isn’t crypto inherently capitalist?” 



Not necessarily. While the headlines are taken by speculation of capital desperately trying to fight off declining rates of profits, the underlying technology is just technology. Moreover, distributed ledgers and computation have no ideological basis (or if they do, they actually favor decentralization and thus have a slight anti-capitalist bent).  

Some technologies, such as Bitcoin, favor centralization due to their commitment to the Proof of Work means of consensus and the subsequent need for specialized hardware. Once again, though, the proposal listed here avoids any such technologies, focusing on widely distributed Proof of Stake mechanisms. Long-term, we can use blockchains even less tied to capital than that. 





Currently, we hold the (meager) funds in the Means Of Production DAO using BREAD tokens, which enable us to ensure that interest on idle funds can fund more left-wing projects. Those interested can find more information at the [Breadchain](https://breadchain.mirror.xyz/boFKBZL9B2OS9lqKJ1a9BZPZgE7RhCpu1RQ0LQPJP1I) project.





#### “Crypto is so unstable, we can’t use it.” 



The dollar and euro value of crypto assets do fluctuate wildly. However, since the library will in no way seek to value itself or its members with these assets (our only internal valuations are in hours), this only decides how to price hours when importing or exporting cash. These can be priced in dollars or euros, eliminating any impact from crypto speculation other than gas fees. As we use the Polygon network, gas fees are also largely eliminated (typical transactions are less than a cent). 

One way this can impact the library is in funds held if the library uses a DAO rather than a bank account. To mitigate this risk, a library can keep its funds in stablecoins - both DAI and USDC are on Polygon. While recent events have shown some stablecoins to be anything but, DAI at least has shown no issues, past or present, primarily because it requires large collateralization in third-party assets. In addition, DAI offers the advantage of being able to be used with Breadchain (see link above). USDC, as potentially hostile capitalist governments can control it, is not recommended now.





#### “How can you tell who owns a wallet? I can just set up hundreds and bypass any checks!”



These crypto tokens offer no proof of identity - anyone can create a new ETH wallet and begin a new identity. 

Like any other library, however, a socialist library can demand proof of identity (whatever works for each library) for membership. So anything from external identification (a photo ID) to collateral in labor or money to biometrics makes sense - or simply the sponsorship of an existing member.  



Issuing a membership token/library card requires the votes of the library - or a smart contract that the library votes to implement or change at will. The library can investigate any suspected fraud or double identity, and if found to be fraudulent, the library can revoke the offending membership tokens.





### Buying line cuts





#### “This is so unfair!”



While incentives to bring capital and do labor for the library are clear, giving the ability of some to use wealth to avoid waits seems undemocratic, unlibrary, or otherwise just wrong. 



However, this does have several benefits which outweigh these concerns.

1. it incentivizes both productive labor and increases in the capital stock of the jointly held library, making all library members materially richer.

2. It allows a more granular measure of members’ desires than a simple binary on or off the list. If it’s crucial to one or more members to have an item at a specific time, they can indicate that through bids. Likewise, since anyone can still sign up for a list without bidding, there is no minimum needed to get an item eventually

3. It avoids the development of black markets to swap positions (often a result of a failure of point #2)

4. It avoids incentivizing the non-value labor working the system. In the abstract sense of most economics, to maximize their advantage, a member should put themselves on a waiting list for every item, in case they want it, as it costs them nothing. Without a way to counteract this, this means that people willing to waste the most time (and force others to do so as well to compete) signing up for items they probably don’t want will have a market advantage to getting items and possibly exploit this as well. Offering a bid system helps to nullify this where education and social pressure can’t. That hour used to sign up for items you don’t want could instead do something useful for the library and enable you to get what you want as well.



The use of quadratic bidding on this is critical. Any bourgeois capitalist seeking to maintain an exclusive lock on the means of production would be required to supply an increasing number of labor vouchers as each loan expires. As a result, they would either need to find an expanding number of other members to support their continued ownership, or they would need to constantly add an expanding amount of capital to the library to keep winning auctions at a rising cost. 



In the former case, the library is acting democratically - the membership is deciding, for whatever reasons, to maintain lending to one person. 

In the latter, the geometric growth of the bids needed means that the would-be capitalist will need to import continuously doubling amounts of capital - and very soon, to prevent the resource from going to someone else, they’d need to donate much more than the replacement value of the item. In this case, the library would happily buy or build another thing. 

And finally, in an extreme case where a bad actor is working to monopolize things for a brief time - say, to hold all tools for ransom during harvest time - the membership of the library can always revoke the membership of the malicious actor through a one-person, one-vote mechanism on membership tokens, even if only temporarily, to avoid artificial scarcity.





#### “This is just capitalism with extra steps!”



It isn’t because the bidding mechanism can **only** operate with labor vouchers, which cannot be transferred or hoarded. Without that, it’s impossible to force labor exploitation through ownership of library goods. Moreover, monopolizing any item in the long term is prevented by quadratic bidding and a democratic membership check on any action.





While there are still markets in line auctions, there is no ability to exploit labor for private profit (as labor vouchers can only transfer to the library) or to turn exploited surplus value into capital. Instead, the library, which is democratically held by all, contains any surplus value not paid to the workers in vouchers.

In other words, you have socialism, if not quite communism, yet.





#### “but ultimately, shouldn’t libraries house the items in the numbers needed/wanted by their community?”



Yes, and part of the reason we want library socialism is that a system based on usufruct can not only make everyone richer, but hopefully allow us to direct the surplus value currently given to the rich to instead focus on moving us as a species to a post-scarcity society as quickly as possible - i.e., communism. 



However, until we can do that, there will be more demanded items than the community can provide. Therefore, we will need to ration their use, at least temporarily.



The existence of waiting lines and how intense (number of people, size of bids) can help us quantify that and see which items are in most demand, and help inform the library of what we should spend resources to acquire more of in the long run.





### labor





#### “Does high skill mean more important?” 



No - it usually means that that type of labor is more difficult to obtain, particularly when library socialism coexists with capitalism. In that case, labor (like medicine) that takes much effort to become proficient was done outside the library socialist system - and that, likewise, the market outside will price that labor as such.   



We recognize all labor as equal, which is why we delineate labor vouchers in hours, and “high-skill” labor is **not** given larger values.   

While the subject of “human capital” is contentious and one that capitalist apologist economists use to hide many of the contradictions of capitalism, a limited subset of it can be helpful in our needs here. Just as in the case of direct cash or good infusion, the library seeks to incentivize the movement of capital (in this case, resources spent for education) into our non-exploitative ecosystem. To do that, we will make sure we will reimburse that portion of the capital they bring for use in the library.



Over time, we would seek to internalize training and education - and remove cost (and pay students for their labor done for the future) from the equation. At that point, we would not need to provide capital reimbursement, so that the library would issue only labor tokens for high-skill services.
