      <h2>Why</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Because there&#39;s no need for every person to buy every tool
        </li>
        <li>
          Because most library software isn&#39;t free, or assumes that the
          library owns the items and can store them locally.
        </li>
        <li>
          Because control of the means of production is the material basis
          for everything
        </li>
        <li>
          Because distributed tool libraries are easier to set up and
          do not require tools to live in a central place!
        </li>
        <li>
          Because Library Socialism is a great idea - if you&#39;d like to
          know more, check out the <a href="#links">links</a>!

      <h2>FAQs about distributed
        libraries
      </h2>
      <h3 id="who-owns-the-items-">Who owns the items?</h3>
      <p>The same people that do now. You are simply advertising your
        willingness to lend the item to
        others. You can impose some conditions on the lenders - for example,
        that they've proven their
        legal name, etc.</p>
      <h3 id="can-i-remove-my-item-from-the-library-">Can I remove my item
        from
        the library?</h3>
      <p>Yes, except you'll need to wait until the borrowers return any items
        currently out on loan. You can then remove
        the item from borrowing.</p>
      <h3 id="what-if-my-item-is-damanged-when-i-lend-it-">What if my item is
        damanged when I lend it?</h3>
      <p>
        Currently, the lender takes that risk. Depending on the library, they
        likely will penalize the borrower to mark
        them as less trustworthy. In the long term, we'll seek to create an
        insurance fund to compensate lenders and
        encourage more lending.
      </p>
      <h3 id="is-there-anything-i-can-t-lend-">Is there anything I can&#39;t
        lend?</h3>
      <p>Nope. If you want to lend food, we advise making it a permanent loan
        unless you're really into composting.
        We ask for legal reasons that you don't list anything you know to be
        illegal.</p>
      <h3 id="what-is-a-permanent-loan">What is a permanent loan</h3>
      <p>
        A permanent loan is where you don't want the item anymore, so you don't
        demand a return date.
      </p>
      <h3 id="isn-t-a-permanent-loan-just-giving-the-item-away-">Isn&#39;t a
        permanent loan just giving the item away?</h3>
      <p>No - per the principle of usufruct, the person can use and profit from
        the item but not permanently stop others from using it.
      </p>
      <p>In plain words, it means I give you the item with the condition you
        don't sell it, instead giving it to someone else if you no longer want
        it.</p>

      <h2>Entities</h2>
      <h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="underline">Borrowers</span> - somebody who has a need
          and
          wishes to use an item to
          fulfill that need</li>
        <li>Lenders - somebody with an item to lend.</li>
        <li>Libraries - organizations which connect Borrowers and Lenders, and
          prevent abuses for the general good. Depending on the type of library,
          a
          library may also be a lender.
          Libraries create Loans of items, and also determine if Borrowers
          remain
          in good standing, if items are returned satisfactorily, etc.</li>

      <h2>Current Domain Objects</h2>
      <h3>Thing</h3>
      <p>Something to be lent out - a good, service, anything</p>
      <h3 id="lender">Lender</h3>
      <p>
        A person or entity that owns an item. They might also be responsible for
        evaluating conditions on return.
      </p>
      <h3 id="borrower">Borrower</h3>
      <p>A person or entity which borrows an item through a <code>Loan</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Borrowers who return items late or damaged can accrue fees or demerits,
        depending on the library policies.
      </p>
      <h3 id="loan">Loan</h3>
      <p>The temporary transfer of an item to a borrower to supply a need.
        Fills
        the Usufruct need - so a borrower might use and enjoy the benefits of
        an
        item, but is not free to destroy or permanently remove it (such as
        selling it).</p>
      <p>Loans may or may not have an expiration. For example, we may consider a
        gift or entitlement to be a loan
        without an expiration date.</p>
      <h3 id="library">Library</h3>
      <p>A library might represent either a library organization, or a
        distributed group of Lenders</p>
      <p>
        Libraries will also be able to allow members from other libraries,
        presenting an easy way to offer a
        unified platform for existing lenders.</p>
      <p>Libraries can enforce policies on behalf of their membership, such as
        maximum items to borrow at one time, fees or points for non-returned
        items, etc.</p>
      <p>Long term integration with voting platforms for libraries is a good
        move to ensure democratic control of libraries.</p>
      <p>Libraries can optionally take Donations, which transfers the location
        to a library.</p>
      <p>Libraries create Loans of Items.</p>
