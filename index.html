        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Because there&#39;s no need for every person to buy every tool
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Because most library software isn&#39;t free, or assumes that the
              library owns the items always and can store them locally.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Because control of the means of production is the material basis
              for everything</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Because distributed tool libraries may be easier to setup, and
              not require tools to live in a central place!</p>
          </li>
          <li>

          libraries
        </h1>
        <h2 id="who-owns-the-items-">Who owns the items?</h2>
        <p>The same people that do now. You are simply advertising that
          you&#39;re
          willing to lend the item to others. You can impose some conditions on
          the lenders - like, for example, they&#39;ve proven their legal name,
          etc.</p>
        <h2 id="can-i-remove-my-item-from-the-library-">Can I remove my item
          from
          the library?</h2>
        <p>Yes, with the exception you&#39;ll need to wait till any current
          loans
          have been returned. You can then remove the item from borrowing.</p>
        <h2 id="what-if-my-item-is-damanged-when-i-lend-it-">What if my item is
          damanged when I lend it?</h2>
        <p>Currently that&#39;s the risk being taken by the lender. Depending on
          the library, they likely will penalize the borrower to mark them as
          less
          trustworthy, and long term we&#39;ll be looking to create an insurance
          fund to partially compensate lenders and encourage more lending.</p>
        <h2 id="is-there-anything-i-can-t-lend-">Is there anything I can&#39;t
          lend?</h2>
        <p>Nope. If you want to lend food, we advise making it a permanent loan,
          unless you&#39;re really into composting. </p>
        <p>We ask for legal reasons you don&#39;t list anything you know to be
          illegal.</p>
        <h2 id="what-is-a-permanent-loan">What is a permanent loan</h2>
        <p>A permanent loan is where you don&#39;t want the item anymore, so you
          don&#39;t demand a return date.</p>
        <h2 id="isn-t-a-permanent-loan-just-giving-the-item-away-">Isn&#39;t a
          permanent loan just giving the item away?</h2>
        <p>No - per the principle of usufruct, it means the person can use and
          profit from the item, but not permanently stop others from using it.
        </p>
        <p>In plain words, it means I give you the item, with the condition you
          don&#39;t sell it, instead giving it to someone else if you no longer
          want it.</p>

        <h1>Entities</h1>
        <h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>
        <p>Borrowers - somebody who has a need and wishes to use an item to
          fulfill that need</p>
        <p>Lenders - somebody with an item to lend.</p>
        <p>Libraries - organizations which connect Borrowers and Lenders, and
          prevent abuses for the general good. Depending on the type of library,
          a
          library may also be a lender.
          Libraries create Loans of items, and also determine if Borrowers
          remain
          in good standing, if items are returned satisfactorily, etc.</p>

        <h3 id="thing">Thing</h3>
        <p>something to be lent out. Can have a <em>borrow cost</em>, which
          reflects a relative worth of the item, to help even out lending if
          needed</p>
        <h3 id="lender">Lender</h3>
        <p>A person or entity that owns an item. They might also be responsible
          for evaluating condition on return.</p>
        <h3 id="borrower">Borrower</h3>
        <p>A person or entity which borrows an item through a <code>Loan</code>.
        </p>
        <p>Borrowers who return items late or with damage can accrue either fees
          or demerits, depending on the library policies.</p>
        <h3 id="loan">Loan</h3>
        <p>The temporary transfer of an item to a borrower to supply a need.
          Fills
          the Usufruct need - so a borrower might use and enjoy the benefits of
          an
          item, but is not free to destroy or permanently remove it (such as
          selling it).</p>
        <p>Loans may or may not have an expiration. A gift or entitlement may be
          considered a loan without an expiration date.</p>
        <h3 id="library">Library</h3>
        <p>A library might represent either a library organization, or a
          distributed group of Lenders</p>
        <p>Libraries will also be able to long term allow members from other
          libraries, presenting an easy way to offer a unified platform for
          existing lenders</p>
        <p>Libraries can enforce policies on behalf of their membership, such as
          maximum items to borrow at one time, fees or points for non-returned
          items, etc.</p>
        <p>Long term integration with voting platforms for libraries is a good
          move to ensure democratic control of libraries.</p>
        <p>Libraries can optionally take Donations, which transfers the location
          to a library.</p>
        <p>Libraries create Loans of Items.</p>
