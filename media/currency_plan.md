# Currency and tokens in library socialism

## Goals
- maximize growth of capital resources that the library society can employ for the benefit of all
  - minimize the amount of resources that are extracted by non-library (capitalist) systems existing in parallel
    - allow interaction with these systems in the short term
  - incentivize investment by members into the library
  - allow expansion of library services for the benefit of all
- reward creation of value by labor 
- prevent exploitation of labor within the library
- provide incentives to abide by library policies
  - protect against members who do not return items

## Token types
### Membership - 
granted to any member of the library who is in good standing
  - non-transferable
  - limit of one per person
  - allows the user to borrow items
  - can be revoked or suspended if policies not followed
  - existing already - MOP 
### Library administration 
should be same token as membership
  - allows voting on library matters
  - includes voting on all purchases, membership, etc 
### Labor token
  - given when members do work to benefit the library
  - denominated in hours
  - more than one sequence of tokens might be generated
    - each represents a devolution of the existing library capital into labor coins, i.e. wages
    - we should coin with the formula of current total library value estimate (dollars)/internal wage (dollars/hour) = number of tokens (hours)
  - creation of items
  - services to members as library items
  - should be issued for time worked 
    - we consider all labor to be equal?
  - need a mechanism for exchange to outside currency
    - ETH/fiat - might be a different price than capital
        - this is export price, controlled by org
    - is the value fixed by vote?  Wage should be above standard
      - consider starting at $50/hr
        - this price is what the capital coin can exchange at, $50 of donation gets one hour labor
    - can pay the fees and fines of the library 
   #### Bonuses
  Certain things should pay a bonus above regular hourly tokens.
  However we do not want this to just become wage labor again! 
    
Perhaps bonuses should be yet another token, with slightly less use than regular labor tokens?

Items for bonus
- onerous work - if you have to clean shit, you shouldn't have to as long
- automation - this is key, and should be VERY high.  If you can design a system to save 100 hours of work, you should get labor vouchers for what you saved to encourage innovation.  But who determines the amount saved?
### Capital token
  - denominated in dollars or fiat on creation
  - issued when capital (funds or goods) are given to the library
  - debited when the library purchases from
    - can have a negative balance, most will!
    - we need to create a Capital Debit token for this, since blockchain doesn't recognize negative
        - this token should ONLY be transferable to the DAO if not in the DAO's wallet
  - organizations the library pays should be debited for later recapture
    - Members of an organization (capitalists) should be held responsible as well for any balance
  - if an org or individual with a negative balance wants to join, they must bring their balance to zero!
    - they can do this by donating money, and thus buying labor coins
  - can be exchanged for labor tokens, but only after a set time period, like 6 months
      - this exchange rate will only be set by library votes!
  - can be traded on external exchanges, we don't care.  We will redeem according to our rules, and we do not use them internally
      - secondary market can provide pricing information for us to use in pricing exchange of labor, and external

## Example flow
Our library aims to have an eventual value of $100,000.
We vote to issue a labor coin, at a wage of $50/hr.  We thus issue 2000 hour coins.
We also create 100,000 capital coins.
Both labor and capital tokens are put into the DAO finances.

The library expects to purchase $200 worth of things.
It creates $200 worth of capital debits, and puts them in the DAO.

A member does 5 hours of work for the library.  
They are paid 5 labor tokens from the DAO.

A member donates goods worth $500 to the library.
They are granted 500 capital tokens from the DAO - which cannot be exchanged for labor tokens for 6 months.
After 6 months, they can exchange these for 10 labor tokens.

The library buys goods from an outside provider for 100.
The provider has a wallet created for them, and is transfered 100 capital debit coins.

The outside provider later wants to use library services.
They are required to get the library to purchase 100 capital debits
The library is willing to buy them for $110 dollars, which the outside provider pays to the library.
The library then takes their debit tokens back.

## Token exchanges
### Labor to external (foreign trade)
Labor tokens should be the only ones which are directly transferable to ETH

The library should designate an amount of ETH/stable coin which is available for purchase by labor token

_this should be far less than the amount of value the total labor token pool represents_, this is how much labor (and capital) the library socialist society is willing to export.  Market mechanisms can work on the price from there

#### example
- The library marks $100 of stable coin as available for purchase, with a total labor coin supply of 1000 MOPL
- Person A, who has 10 MOPT, wants to trade these for dollars to buy video games
- Person B has 3 MOPT and wants to trade to dollars as well
- Person A bids 1 MOPT for $50
- Person B bids 2 MOPT for $50, etc
- auction ends at Person A buying $50 for 4 MOPT
- MOPT goes back to library, stable coin is transferred to Person A


#### Question - 
should labor go through the library for safety, or be allowed to transfer?
if to transfer, can we do ensure they can ONLY transfer to wallets with a MOP membership token?
